#Feature Risk

Feature risk as determined by the color of the feature.  

Current feature risk colors:
        '#107c1e': 'On Track',
        '#df1a7b': 'High Risk',
        '#fce205': 'Moderate Risk',
        '#f9a814': 'High Risk',
        '#ee6c19': 'High Risk'

All other feature colors (or lack of color) are ignored and represented by "Other".  

The number of features represented in the Feature Risk pie should equal the Total number of features minus the delivered features.

Delivered features are features in the "Done" or "Operate" state.
